# Garage-Door-Project

The goal of this project was to design a garage door opener using an ESP8266, Arduino IDE, and Web Application with MySQL database
There are multiple reasons to have one in the first place: forgetting the remote for the garage, or someone else might want to try to open the garage
remotely. Securtiy features such as a login page with username and password have been added.
